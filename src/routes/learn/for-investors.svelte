<h1>Investment funding on Radix</h1>
<p>
  Radstarter is a community curated launchpad for startups, daos and platforms
  built on radix. It's a platform where projects can raise money, launch
  their tokens and build a community. It's a place for investors to find 
  new Radix projects to join. 
</p>
<h2>FAQ</h2>
<h3>How does it work?</h3>
<p>
  The platform is governed by a dao (Decentralised Autonomous Organisation)
  this means that every project that raises with us is approved through community
  voting. Stakeholders get to decide where capital flows, which projects to 
  invest in and the percentage we take. If a project wants to raise with us,
  they have to create a public proposal with all the details and submit it
  to the voting platform. Then the collective can vote for or against.
</p>
<p>
  All profit from raises is divided between stakeholders in the dao. The dao has the option to
  buy tokens from projects we launch with capital from the vault. So we are 
  not only a launchpad but also an incubator for innovative platforms on radix.
</p>

<h3>How do I become a stakeholder?</h3>
<p>
  All you need to do is buy tokens, and you can participate in voting and earn 
  dividends. Tokens can be bought on the open market, or on the limited
  curve.
</p>

<h3>What is a limited curve?</h3>
<p>
  It is a curve that decides the price of the current token. You can see it as
  a gumball machine that sells tokens, but every token that is bought increases
  the price of the next token. This is to reward early investors and believers
  in the project. When more people believe in the project, it becomes more
  expensive. Bonding curves are usually unlimited, but our limited 
  curves have a fixed supply of tokens.
</p>
<h3>When will governance be completely implemented?</h3>
<p>
  We are currently working together with the radix programmer guild to build 
  the backbone of our governance platform. We will roll it out piece by piece
  and slowly take off the training wheels. First we will roll out voting for
  the curation of projects, after that voting to control the vault. We will
  start moving more and more funds into the dao controlled vault until security
  is optimal, then all the funds will be controlled by the dao.
</p>
<h3>How do dividends work?</h3>
<p>
  Dividends will be payed out automatically to all token holders twice a year.
  Dividends will be payed out in XRD, until there is a stablecoin on radix.
  The gas cost will be substracted from your earnings (~ 5 cents).
</p>
<p>
  There are two vaults one that holds the funds of the dao, the dao-vault. 
  One that holds the earnings, the dividend-vault. The profits from raises
  automatically go to the dividend-vault. And it gets triggered twice a year
  to pay out the profits. The dao-vault generates it's profits from holding 
  NAME tokens. There will be token buybacks.
