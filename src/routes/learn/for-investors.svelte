  <h1>Invest in  the decentralised revolution</h1>
  <h3>
    Radstarter is a digital marketplace built on Radix
    giving you exposure to the best projects on ledger.
  </h3>
  <h4>How do I sign up?</h4>
  <p> The  platform isn't live yet but you can join the seed sale.<p>
  <h4>Are there any costs involved?</h4>
  <p>
    Investing on Radstarter is completely free for investors. We will never
    charge you any fees. But since the raises happen on ledger you will have to
    pay the gas. This is a very small fee on the Radix ledger.
  </p>
  <h4>Who can invest on Radstarter?</h4>
  <p>
    If you live in America you have to be an accredited investor. If you aren't
    you have to check if you aren't on <a href="/tos#banned-countries">the list of 
      banned countries</a>. If your country isn't listed you are free to invest as
    you please.
  </p>

  <h4>What kind of ventures can I find on Radstarter?</h4>
  <p>
    You can find crypto companies and DAOs that operate on the Radix 
    ledger. In the future we want to create the legal framework to launch
    regular non-crypto companies on the radix ledger.
  </p>
  <h4>How are projects chosen to be featured on Radstarter?</h4>
  <p>
    They have to apply on the application page then the DAO screens them.
    You can follow the screening of new projects on our discord and ask 
    the project's representative questions. Everything happens in the open.
  </p>

  <h4>Are you an IDO platform?</h4>
  <p>
    No we don't do Initial Dex Offerings, we have specialized blueprints/smart-contracts
    to sell tokens to investors. Either at a fixed price or on a limited curve.
  </p>
  <div id="limited-curve">
    <h4>What is a Limited Curve?</h4>
    <p> A limited curve is a bonding curve in a smart contract that sells tokens
      but has no option to re-buy them. The curve dictates the price of the token.
      It  goes up as more tokens are sold. There is a specified limit on the amount
      of tokens that can be sold by a limited curve contract.
    </p>
  </div>
  <h4>Do I need to stake $RST to get access to the offerings?</h4>
  <p>
    No you don't need to stake anything, everybody has open access to the raises.
    Our token is a governance/profit-share token. Staking is there to claim your
    share of the profits we make.
  </p>
  <h4>What can I invest with?</h4>
  <p>
    For now you can only invest with XRD, once a stablecoin launches on the Radix
    ledger you will be able to pay with stablecoins. But if you want to pay with
    stablecoins you will have to do KYC.
