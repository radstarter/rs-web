  <h3>How to earn?</h3>
  <p>
    We are <i>currently</i> using SourceCred to track contributions, it allows you to 
    earn cred and RST by contributing value to our github, forum or discord. 
    It is recommended to read 
    <a href="https://sourcecred.io/docs/" target="_blank">the docs</a>. SourceCred
    is your foot in the door of the collective. It allows you to earn a modest 
    amount of tokens and cred. To complement SourceCred, there are bounties.
    These are certain tasks that have a high priority in the DAO, doing these will
    allow you to earn a decent amount of tokens no extra cred is minted for completing
    bounties.
    Once the DAO goes live all your earned Cred will be minted as reputation on the
    governance platform.
  </p>
  <h3>What bounties are there?</h3>
  <p>
    Take a look at the bounties over at
    <a href="https://forum.radstarter.io/c/teams/7" target="_blank">the teams section
      of the forum</a>. That's the place where all bounties will be listed. And if you
    think of jobs that need work you can suggest them there.
